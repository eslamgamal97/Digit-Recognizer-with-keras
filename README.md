# Digit-Recognizer-with-keras

Digit Recognizer with Keras Project.

I used MNIST Dataset in this project and designed a model to predict handwritten digit numbers.

The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification 
problem.

Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard split of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and 
a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it.

There are 10 digits to predict (from 0 to 9). 

Training Accuracy = **99.8%**

Test Accuracy = **97.34%**

**Output of the model:**
